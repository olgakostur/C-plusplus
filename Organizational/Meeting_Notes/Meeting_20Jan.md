# Meeting Notes with Deborah Pelacani Cruz – 20/01/22
*2:30pm-3pm*

### General Q&A

-	Don’t do conversions of 1d to 2d -> sticking to 1D
-	1d workings sticks to 1d memory
-	Can however use double pointers if you want to use 2d arrays BUT keep in mind contiguous aspect of data storage
-	Code breaks easily if rows are not linearly independent  for gaussian so be careful
-	For vector use vector type from stl no need for vector class

### Actions

**Testing**

-	Cerr and stopping code when inputs don’t match -> raise flags
-	Ctime for performance

**Other**

-	Input: Keyword with manual matrix input or choice of inputting a text file
-	1D only
-	Starting with 3x3 matrix -> dense from matrix.cpp from class, solving it by hand, understanding the workings of the method on paper before coding and expanding the size of the initial matrix
-	Use of template, matmatmult and code from lecture 5 on solvers
