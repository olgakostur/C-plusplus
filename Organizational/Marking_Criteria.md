# Recap of Group Assignement Marking Criteria


Code will be compiled and executed as part of the evaluation. If your code does not compile, or does not solve a positive definite linear system of any size correctly, you will be heavily penalised.
We will mark the projects based on: 

- Code **structure** and **style (30/100)**
- Implementing of **loading/writing/linear solver (30/100)**
- **User experience, creativity and execution (20/100)**
- Code **documentation/commenting (10/100)**
- Short (less than 4 pages) **report (10/100)** 


NB: Reference code taken outside of the current course eg. taken from other MSc courses
