# Validation Folder 

This folder contains the code for comparison between Python code (adapted from Lecture 5) and C++  written solvers.

The same test matrices/vectors can be found in both .ipynb and method_testx.txt files for each method. The method_testx_output.txt files represent the outputs by running the C++ solvers, which can be compared with the results from the .ipynb files.
